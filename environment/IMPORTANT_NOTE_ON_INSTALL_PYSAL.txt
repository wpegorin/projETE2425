If pysal throws an error related with import "scipy" name inf it should be edited the referenced file to import from numpy (instead of scipy)
(this practice should be avoid in general but it seems, for now, a solution)

NOTE:
Usually, the problem is associated with the library "cg" and, specifically with the fuction KDTree
File located usually on (at a Conda/Mamba environment management):
c:\Users\...\AppData\Local\miniforge3\envs\projETE2324_v2\lib\site-packages\libpysal\cg\kdtree.py
